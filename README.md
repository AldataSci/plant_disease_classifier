# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

This is An end-to-end computer vision application that identifies 15 different plant diseases using a fine-tuned ResNet18 architecture.

## 📊 Results
- **Final Test Accuracy:** 98.45%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 98.51%
- **Baseline CNN Accuracy:** 93.8%

## 🧠 Project Narrative
In this project, I explored three different approaches to find the most effective model:
1. **Custom CNN:** Built a 3-layer CNN from scratch. Achieved a solid 93.8% accuracy.
2. **Transfer Learning (Frozen):** Used a pretrained ResNet18 but kept the backbone frozen. Accuracy dropped to 87.9%, proving that ImageNet features need adaptation for specialized botanical data.
3. **Fine-Tuning (Unfrozen):** Unfroze the ResNet18 backbone and trained with a low learning rate (1e-4). This achieved our peak performance of 98.45%.

### ⚠️ The "Domain Shift" Lesson
During deployment, I identified a performance gap when testing with "real-world" images from Google Search compared to the lab-controlled **PlantVillage** dataset. To address this, I implemented a **Sample Image** feature in the app to demonstrate the model's high performance on in-distribution data while providing transparency regarding out-of-distribution field images.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
